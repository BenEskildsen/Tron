- - - - - TODO - - - - -
  - handle game over
    - modal
      - showing who won
      - rematch button that checks for both players having pressed it
        - set ready state back to false, then same logic as Start in lobby


- - - - - LATER - - - - - -
  - only allow one direction change per tick(?)
  - show editable settings in the lobby
  - display number of boosts remaining
  - render world
    - doing it by pixel looks terrible :(


- - - - - for multiplayer - - - - -
  - copy over UI/Main
  - hotkey handling for changing directions
    - hotKeyHandler should use full state and not just hotkeys
